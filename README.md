# sms.theater

Month-long candid text conversations focused loosely on industry or interest.

## Next
* Turn this into a platform rather than a publication

## Ideas on v2
* Anyone can text the number and create their own SMS.theater
* Person A will then get a code they can share with someone else, if Person B texts the SMS.theater number the same code, a SMS.theater unique URL is created, sent to each person.
* customize length of days available to text (max 30)
* One SMS.theater at a time...? Or do I need to use Twilio API to get multiple numbers...?
* commands available
  * /subject sets subject
  * /bio creates personal bio
  * /avatar + photo uploads photo
  * /delete deletes SMS.theater
  * /help sends link with FAQ
  * /url returns URL (for sharing)

* Featured theaters (uhhhh plays? ::chill::)
